# Qiskit Tutorials

My attempt at the IBM Q Qiskit tutorials so that I can gain a better understanding of quantum computing. For info head to https://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q/learn/what-is-ibm-q.

If you want to use these tutorials as a Gist you will need to register for your own API token - just follow the instructions at https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html

Once you have your API token, add it to the config.py file within the setup folder, and assign the token to the constant IBM_Q_API_TOKEN in this file (make sure you don't post it up anywhere!!). Then run registercredentials.py which create a token file for you which your projects will now use (you should only need to run this once). This will create a qiskitrc file on your local machine which should mean you don't need to authenticate on other projects using IBM Q (don't quote me on it though)!
